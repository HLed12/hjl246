'hjl246' is the package I am developing for the coursework component of GEOG246-346 (Geospatial Analysis with R).

It currently has three functions, 'my_number_checker', which is executed as follows:

```{r}
library(hjl246)
my_number_checker(1)
my_number_checker(7)
my_number_checker(20)
```

'my_multiplier', which is executed as follows:

```{r}
my_multiplier(1)
my_multiplier(7)
my_multiplier(20)
```

and 'my_calc', which is executed as follows:

```{r}
my_calc(1, 1, "sum")
my_calc(2, 1, "subtract")
my_calc(20, 2, "divide")
my_calc(20, 2, "multiply")
```


I will be adding others, and updating this vignette as we go.
