Unit 1 Module 3 questions:
Question: why shouldn’t you use the name “df” to name this object?
  •	df is very vague//lacks description and can be easily overwritten.
Question: why is it okay to rename a column in DF “c”, but not to rename v3 as c?
  •	The actual object, v3, should never be named c due to the function concatenate (combine) and how this could create issues with mirroring.
Look at the str of DF. What kind of data type is “grp”? How would you change it between character and factor and back again?
  •	Grp is a chr type (character). To change this to factor you could write
•	DF$grp <- as.factor(DF$grp)
•	To change it back:
  •	DF$grp <- as.character(DF$grp)
