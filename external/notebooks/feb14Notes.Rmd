```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r}
set.seed(50)
dat <- data.frame(v1 = 1:20, v2 = sample(1:100, 20, replace = TRUE),
                  v3 = runif(20, 0, 50), v4 = sample(LETTERS, 20, replace = TRUE))
                  
                  
dat
```
can't index v4 based on v2 because v2 isn't created outside of the function!
